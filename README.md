# Your Story Matters (YSM)

![GitHub Actions CI workflow badge](https://github.com/chaynHQ/ysm/workflows/YSM%20CI%20pipeline/badge.svg)

A companion app for survivors of sexual assault.

**Currently in active development**

This repo consists of:

- [`ysm-frontend`](ysm-frontend/README.md)

Each folder is designed to be opened in a code editor on it's own – i.e. all config, linting rules, scripts, etc. are self contained for that folder only, and nothing at the top level (root folder). VSCode workspace settings per folder are provided for things like linting and code pretty-fying.

Commits messages should be prepended with the relevant name (e.g.: `[frontend] Fixed UI bug that…`).
